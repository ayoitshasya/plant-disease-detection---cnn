# Plant Disease Detection using CNN

### 🍀Description:

Plant diseases pose a significant threat to agricultural productivity worldwide. 
Early and accurate detection of these diseases can help in taking preventive measures and minimizing crop loss. 
This project aims to develop a deep learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to detect and 
classify plant diseases from leaf images. The model leverages image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms 
to provide an efficient and scalable solution for plant disease detection.

### 🍀Installation:

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

- open the **'app.py'** file in prefered workspace i.e. VSCode or Pycharm
- install all the requirements present in the **'requirements.txt'** on the terminal

### 🍀Working with the NoteBook file (Plant_disease_detection(CNN).ipynb)
- after running each and every cell in the ipynb file during the last step the whole trained model gets saved
  to plant_disease_prediction_model.h5
- this file path will be further pasted in the app.py file

### 🍀Installation and setting up dataset file:
- To download the PlantVillage dataset using Kaggle API, follow these steps:
  1. Go to Kaggle webpage:
  2. click on your profile icon -> click on settings⚙️
  3. Scroll down to **API**
  4. Click on 'Create new Token' -> this will install a kaggle.json file
  5. Upload this file on the workspace which is being used for this project.
